# RPI-Pico-Interfacing-LCD
This project uses the RPI Pico simulation to control a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) display using I2C. I utilized the RPI Pico SDK, created a counter stopwatch, and used an external LED to display the 1Hz blinking LED for every count. 

## Description
This project contains a C++ program that sets up an I2C pin and GPIO pins to create a second counter stopwatch. The counter will start counting when the button is pressed and stop when the button is pressed again and function as a toggle. The seconds will then display on the LCD and display the 1Hz blinking LED for every count.
